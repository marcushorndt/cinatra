/**
 * Access-vs-ownership clarity.
 *
 * A reusable, Google-Drive-style explainer that resource creation + sharing
 * surfaces render to disambiguate the two concepts:
 *   - OWNERSHIP — which scope (user / team / organization / workspace) the
 *     resource belongs to. Fixed at creation; drives the billing + lifecycle.
 *   - ACCESS — which principals can read / write / admin it, granted on top
 *     of ownership (project_access grants, role grants).
 *
 * Drop it into the PageContent of a permissions / sharing surface above the
 * grant controls. Uses the shadcn Alert primitive + semantic tokens only.
