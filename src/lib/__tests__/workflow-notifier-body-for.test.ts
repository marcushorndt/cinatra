/**
 * Behavioral body-text contract for `approval_resolved`.
 *
 * `bodyFor` in `src/lib/workflow-notifier.ts` is module-private — exercise it
 * via the public `buildWorkflowNotifier()` API and capture the body string
 * passed to `createNotificationForRecipient`. The matrix test in
 * `packages/workflows/src/__tests__/notifications.test.ts` pins routing
 * (`approval_resolved` → `["owner"]`) and envelope shape; this test pins the
 * rendered body the requester actually sees, which is non-trivial:
 *
 *   - `approved` → "...was approved by <decider>."
 *   - `rejected` → "...was rejected by <decider>."
 *   - `needs_revision` → "...asked for revision on..."
 *   - reason → appended as " Note: <reason>"
 *   - no decider → no " by ..." suffix
 *   - no reason → no Note suffix
 *
 * Guards against a regression where decision-verb mapping breaks
 * (e.g. `needs_revision` falls through to "decided") or the reason/decider
 * substitutions are dropped.
