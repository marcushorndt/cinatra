# Instance Namespace — Freeze Rule and Policy Hooks

> Co-located with the validator module so future maintainers see this when grep'ing for `validateInstanceNamespace`. The validator IS the policy hook; this doc records the constraints around it.

## The Single-Export Rule

`validateInstanceNamespace` is the only place in the codebase that owns:

1. The format regex `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{1,38}$` (lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens, must start with alphanumeric, 2–39 chars)
2. The reserved-substring policy (currently `["cinatra"]`, see `reserved-patterns.ts`)
3. The canonicalization rule (`trim → lowercase`)
4. The error-ordering contract (`required → format → reserved → uniqueness/provisioning [reserved slot]`)

All consumers MUST import from `@/lib/instance-namespace` (the barrel). The single-export-site assertion test (`__tests__/single-export-site.test.ts`) enforces this — a parallel regex or an inline copy of the rules will fail CI.

## Current Consumers

| Consumer | Role |
|----------|------|
| `src/app/setup/name/instance-namespace-input.tsx` | Wizard client island — live validation as the user types |
| `src/app/setup/name/actions.ts` (`saveInstanceIdentityAction`) | Server-side gate during initial setup |
| `src/app/configuration/instance/rename-confirmation.tsx` (`RenameConfirmation`) | Administration rename modal — live validation in the post-freeze rename dialog |
| `src/app/configuration/instance/actions.ts` (`editVendorAction`) | Server-side gate for pre-publish credential edits |
| `src/app/configuration/instance/actions.ts` (`renameInstanceNamespaceAction`) | Server-side gate for post-freeze renames |

## The Freeze Rule

Once an instance has published its first extension under its current namespace, `firstPublishedAt` is set to a non-null timestamp and the namespace is **frozen**:

- `editVendorAction` rejects with "Cannot edit — vendor name is frozen. Use Rename instead." when `firstPublishedAt !== null`.
- `renameInstanceNamespaceAction` is the only path forward, and it appends the previous identity to `oldInstanceNamespaces[]`.

The validator does NOT know about the freeze rule — that lives in the actions. **Both freeze-state guards still call the validator first**, so a frozen namespace cannot be renamed *to* a reserved value either.

## Current Non-Goals

The current policy intentionally excludes:

- **No new rename UI.** `RenameConfirmation` is the existing rename UI; the validator must remain wired into that flow. If a new rename surface is added, it MUST call `validateInstanceNamespace`.
- **No fetch-at-startup for the reserved list.** `reserved-patterns.ts` is the canonical source, consumed directly by the validator; there is no runtime fetch. To change the list, edit that file (see "Updating the Reserved List" below).
- **No display-name validation.** This handles namespace only. `instanceDisplayName` keeps its existing Zod schema in `saveInstanceIdentityAction`.
- **No registry uniqueness check during typing.** Registry provisioning happens at submit; uniqueness is enforced by Verdaccio's `createNpmUser` returning `VerdaccioUserAlreadyRegisteredError`.

## Adding a New Consumer

If a new endpoint accepts or persists `instanceNamespace`:

1. Import `validateInstanceNamespace` from `@/lib/instance-namespace` (the barrel — never sub-paths).
2. Call it on `String(formData.get("instanceNamespace") ?? "")` (or wherever the raw input arrives).
3. On `!result.ok`, compose the verbatim error string from the structured payload and route through your action's existing error-redirect path. Reuse the `composeNamespaceErrorMessage` helper if the new endpoint redirects to a server-rendered error surface; render the structured payload directly if it's a JSON API.
4. Persist `result.canonical`, never the raw form value.
5. Add the new consumer file path to `__tests__/single-export-site.test.ts`'s `CONSUMER_FILES` array so the assertion covers it.

## Updating the Reserved List

If the reserved-patterns list gains a new entry:

1. Edit `reserved-patterns.ts` to mirror the change.
2. Add a test case in `__tests__/validator.test.ts` for the new substring.
3. The verbatim error message in `composeNamespaceErrorMessage` interpolates the matched substring — no copy change needed for the error string itself, but verify the rendered text reads correctly with the new word in the slot.

## Verbatim Error Copy (locked)

Reserved-substring (server + client both render this with `<canonical>` and `<reservedSubstring>` filled from validator output):

> Instance namespace "<canonical>" contains the reserved substring "<reservedSubstring>" and is restricted. Names containing "<reservedSubstring>" are reserved for Cinatra.ai-affiliated instances and require pre-registration. To request approval, open a GitHub issue at Cinatra-ai/cinatra.

The trailing phrase is a clickable link in the client island only. The server-redirect path renders it as plain text inside an `Alert` banner.

Format error (server + client variants share this copy):

> Instance namespace must be 2–39 lowercase letters, digits, or hyphens, starting with a letter or digit.

Required error (server-side):

> Instance namespace is required.
