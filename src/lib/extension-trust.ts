// Extension trust classification — VENDOR-AGNOSTIC.
//
// PURE + fail-closed. "Trusted" gates whether an extension's code may be
// dynamically imported IN-PROCESS by the host. The trust root is NOT a
// hard-coded vendor scope — scope confers ZERO
// trust. Instead a package is import-trusted ONLY when ALL hold:
//   1. a persisted host trust decision exists for it (the DB install row),
//      and it is not an explicit revocation;
//   2. its tarball integrity was verified (SRI matched the recorded digest);
//   3. its resolved registry host is in `trustedActivationHosts` — sourced ONLY
//      from the deployment's `publicRegistryUrl` (the marketplace), NEVER the
//      instance's own publish target (see extension-trust-config.ts). An
//      instance-local / private-Verdaccio host is simply absent → denied;
//   4. EITHER a cryptographic signature verified against a host-trusted key
//      (`trusted-signed` — the vendor-agnostic root), OR — during the
//      pre-signature transition — `allowMarketplaceBootstrapTrust` is on and no
//      signature is present (`trusted-bootstrap`, Window-1 parity).
//
// A signed marketplace artifact verified against a host-configured key is NOT
// untrusted code — the signature is the boundary that lets ANY marketplace vendor
// activate in-process WITHOUT container isolation. Isolation remains required only
// for unsigned / non-marketplace / instance-local code, which stays DENIED.
// In prod an UNTRUSTED package is NEVER imported in-process (fail-closed).
//
// IMPORT-trust here is DECOUPLED from privileged host capability (ports + DDL):
// auto-granting privileged ports / running host DDL requires `trusted-signed` (or
// an explicit admin grant), NEVER `trusted-bootstrap` alone — enforced by the
// install pipeline + saga + loader callers. A bootstrap-trusted package may
// import, but does not silently receive privileged capabilities.
//
// This module is PURE: the host-derived `trustedActivationHosts` /
// `allowMarketplaceBootstrapTrust` inputs are computed by the server-only
// `extension-trust-config.ts` and passed in, so the classifier stays unit-testable
// over explicit inputs.
