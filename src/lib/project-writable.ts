/**
 * `assertProjectWritable` helper.
 *
 * Single chokepoint for the project-side write-block predicate used by
 * every project-inheritance write, project-move target check, and binding
 * mutate entry point. The helper composes three orthogonal checks:
 *
 *   1. Project EXISTS (404-hidden when missing — never reveal the
 *      requested id is a known/unknown row).
 *   2. Project is NOT archived (archived
 *      projects are read-only / move-out-only; every new write rejects).
 *   3. Actor has the requested role tier (`read` < `write` < `admin`)
 *      via `actor.projectGrants` — the canonical project-access axis.
 *
 * The platform_admin role bypasses checks 2 and 3 ONLY when the project
 * exists. Archived rows still reject for non-admins, but admins can
 * still write to an archived project for moderation / incident response
 * (mirrors the kernel admin bypass pattern at `enforce.ts:67`).
 *
 * The helper is fail-closed by default:
 *   - Missing actor              → 404-hidden (treat as no-session).
 *   - Missing/unresolved grants  → 403 forbidden (session-derived actors
 *                                  should never leave grants unresolved;
 *                                  session-derived actor; an undefined
 *                                  `projectGrants` axis means "legacy
 *                                  sync caller without project
 *                                  visibility" — deny rather than
 *                                  silently pass).
 *   - Insufficient role          → 403 forbidden.
 *   - Archived project           → 403 forbidden (NOT 404 — the row
 *                                  exists, the actor knows it exists
 *                                  from their grant; 403 is the correct
 *                                  envelope for "exists but blocked").
 *
 * Move semantics and archive lifecycle writes gate their write paths
 * through this helper: archive writes set `archived_at`; this helper
 * reads it before allowing later writes.
 *
 * Read path (when `mode="read"`): the helper exists as a one-stop gate
 * for callers that need both "exists + not archived + has grant" in a
 * single check. For pure read-list paths use `assertProjectReadAccess`
 * from `@/lib/sealed-room` instead — that helper 404-hides without
 * the existence read (cheaper) and is the canonical entry for the
 * sealed-room contract.

/**
 * Synchronous archive gate for sync writers.
 *
 * The canonical write paths inside an agent run's projectContext frame
 * (`upsertObjectAndEnqueue`, `upsertObject`, artifact-creation's
 * semantic-artifact INSERT) are all SYNCHRONOUS — they bridge through
 * the postgres-sync worker so the host-app's async hooks (the
 * mcpRequestContextStorage frame, the agentic-run's projectContext) are
 * preserved across the write. We cannot `await` an async row read in
 * those paths without breaking the frame propagation.
 *
 * `assertProjectWritableSync` reads `projects.archived_at` via the
 * postgres-sync worker (the same channel the writer uses) and rejects
 * when the target project is archived. It DOES NOT check the role gate
 * — write-time inheritance is gated upstream by the
 * handler's `enforceResourceAccess`, which already verified the actor
 * holds object.update / object.write. The archive check is the new
 * archive check: even a permitted writer is blocked when the target
 * project is archived.
 *
 * Implementation note: the sync writer paths (upsertObjectAndEnqueue,
 * artifact-creation) are ALREADY inside a synchronous context. Adding
 * one more sync postgres-sync call adds one round trip. That's
 * acceptable — write-time archive check is rare (only fires when a
 * project frame is active AND the project happens to be archived,
 * which is a misuse) and the SELECT is partial-indexed.
