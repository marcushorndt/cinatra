/**
 * Path-gated Playwright config for the RBAC browser authorization suite.
 *
 * Mirrors the notifications suite config. Defaults to port 3000 (the
 * canonical local dev server); override with E2E_PORT / E2E_BASE_URL to
 * point at a clone band. The unit-level resolver matrix
 * (src/lib/authz/__tests__/resolver-matrix.test.ts) is the
 * primary CI proof of resolver correctness; this browser suite is the
 * representative end-to-end arm and runs in the full e2e env (Postgres +
 * Redis service containers + a seeded multi-actor fixture).
 *
 * Two setup projects + two chromium projects:
 *   - `setup-member` (auth.setup.ts) creates the non-admin member, the
 *     owned project, and the customer user; saves member state.
 *   - `setup-customer` (auth.customer.setup.ts) signs in as the customer
 *     user and saves their state for the customer scoped-view test.
 *   - `chromium-member` runs everything EXCEPT the customer-scoped spec under the
 *     member state.
 *   - `chromium-customer` runs ONLY the customer-scoped spec under the customer
 *     state.
 *
 * Run locally:
 *   pnpm dev                       # in another shell (port 3000)
 *   CI= pnpm test:e2e:rbac         # CI= forces reuseExistingServer
