/**
 * Customer auth setup — signs in as the customer user created in the member
 * setup (auth.setup.ts) and saves a SEPARATE storageState for the
 * scoped-view test.
 *
 * The customer is a `member`-role member of the project's org (added by
 * auth.setup.ts) — required so the project_access grant can attach to
 * them. They have no platform/org admin role and no metric.read grant, so
 * the scoped-view assertions hold (Analytics hidden in nav; admin pages
 * denied). The customer's active org is set to the project's org so /desk
 * renders the app shell.
