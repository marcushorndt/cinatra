/**
 * Vendor-application state reconcile worker.
 *
 * Sibling to `@cinatra-ai/marketplace-sync`'s `runMarketplaceSync`. Drives the
 * `vendor_application_complete_recovery` ability on the cm side for every
 * namespace-reservation row this cinatra instance considers "stuck": the
 * broker (Verdaccio user) + WP cap-grant (CAP_VENDOR_PUBLISH) have already
 * completed marketplace-side, but the final DB flip from `applied` →
 * `approved` did not land (network blip, half-failed approve, etc.).
 *
 * Composition:
 *   - `getStuckApplications()` — fn returning the bounded candidate set this
 *     run should attempt to recover. Wiring lives in the cinatra-side deps
 *     factory (`buildVendorApplicationReconcileDeps`); for the v0 single-
 *     instance shape this resolves to a 0-or-1 element list derived from the
 *     local `instance_identity.vendorApplicationId` slot when
 *     `vendorState === "applied"`. Multi-instance / admin-queue iteration is
 *     a follow-up.
 *   - `client.vendorApplicationCompleteRecovery({ application_id })` — the
 *     PRINCIPAL_SYNC_WORKER-only ability that re-runs the broker + cap-grant
 *     + DB flip as one idempotent unit. Returns a state union the worker
 *     interprets as recovery-success vs needs-retry.
 *
 * Telemetry:
 *   - Per-run `{ recovered, failed, attempted }` is returned for the BullMQ
 *     dispatcher to log. Per-application failures are warned + counted but
 *     do not throw (one bad row must not stop the rest, and the loop must
 *     always re-delay).
 */

/**
 * Narrow structural interface for the one client method we call. Declared
 * here (rather than imported from `@cinatra-ai/marketplace-mcp-client`) so
 * this worker stays compilable while the sibling chunk ships the typed
 * wrapper on `MarketplaceMcpClient`. Once that wrapper lands, the deps factory can
 * pass a `MarketplaceMcpClient` directly and TypeScript will satisfy the
 * structural match on the single method.

/**
 * Shape of `vendor_application_complete_recovery`'s output. Faithful to the
 * cm-side ability contract — a discriminated union over the recovery outcome:
 *
 *   - `state: "approved"` — DB flip landed (or the row was already approved on
 *     an idempotent re-run, signalled by `already_approved`). Recovery
 *     successful → recovered.
 *   - `state: "stuck"` — the recovery-attempt cap is exhausted; the saga is
 *     terminally stuck and will NOT auto-retry. `repair_stuck_at` records when
 *     it was marked. The worker records the durable local flag (via `onStuck`)
 *     and stops attempting this application → stuck.
 *   - `state: "applied"` + `retriable: true` — the saga started/restarted but
 *     the row has not flipped yet and the cap is not reached. The next cycle
 *     retries → failed (counted for retry, non-fatal).
 *   - `state: "applied"` + `recovery_not_applicable: true` — no saga is
 *     in-flight (commercial pending / pre-broker). A benign skip → skipped,
 *     NOT a failure.
 *
 * The trailing structural fallbacks keep the worker compilable against
 * contract drift; an unrecognised shape is treated as non-terminal (failed).
