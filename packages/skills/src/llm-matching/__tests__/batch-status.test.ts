/**
 * Invariant tests for the OpenAI Batch API status sets. The two subsets MUST
 * be disjoint (no status is both in-flight and terminal) AND their union MUST
 * equal the documented OpenAI Batch enum so a future status drift on either
 * side is caught at unit-test time, not via a frozen status panel in
 * production.
 *
 * Reference: OpenAI Batch API docs (status field). Snapshot of the documented
 * statuses as of 2026-05-11:
 *   - validating  (in-flight)
 *   - in_progress (in-flight)
 *   - finalizing  (in-flight)
 *   - completed   (terminal)
 *   - cancelled   (terminal)
 *   - failed      (terminal)
 *   - expired     (terminal)
 *
 * If OpenAI introduces a new status (e.g. `awaiting_quota`), the constants
 * module MUST be updated AND this test must be updated with the new
 * EXPECTED_OPENAI_STATUSES entry — failing this test is the signal to do so.
