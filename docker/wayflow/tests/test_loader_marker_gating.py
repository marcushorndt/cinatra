    The TS backfill (``packages/agents/src/materialize-agent-package.ts:
    backfillPublishedMarkers``) also rewrites stale
    ``.cinatra-published.json`` markers (sha mismatch / malformed JSON /
    missing required keys), guarded by the ``.cinatra-in-progress.json``
    draft marker.

    The Python ``_backfill_missing_markers`` stays MISSING-ONLY because
    the wayflow container mounts ``./agents:/agents:ro`` and cannot
    write. The TS backfill runs first at boot (from
    ``src/instrumentation.node.ts``) so any stale markers are already
    repaired by the time the wayflow loader scans.

    This test pins the Python behavior so a future contributor who
    looks at the TS rewrite and "fixes" the Python side to match does
    not silently break the read-only invariant. Companion to
    ``packages/agents/src/__tests__/backfill-stale-marker-rewrite.test.ts``
    on the TS side.
