// The extension SOURCE tree is not committed to this
// tree — it is cloned back from the companion repos (cinatra-ai/<slug>)
// before build/gate jobs run (CI: the `clone-extensions` composite action /
// `scripts/ci/sync-dev-extensions.mjs`; dev: `cinatra setup dev`). An IoC /
// inventory gate that scans an ABSENT or UNDER-POPULATED `extensions/` tree
// would derive an empty banned-set and pass VACUOUSLY — a silent protection
// regression. This asserts the tree carries at least as many extension packages
// as `cinatraDevExtensions` declares, so a job that forgot the clone-back step
// fails LOUDLY instead of greenwashing.
//
// Floor = the declared `cinatraDevExtensions` count (not a bare "0 extensions"
// check): a job that cloned back only SOME of the declared extensions still
// fails loudly, which a "found 0" check would miss.
